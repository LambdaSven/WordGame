# Word Game

This is going to be a small word-game for playing with friends. It will be a web-app, with accounts and lobbies.
The games will be time limited, and allow custom limitations such as min word length, scoring rules, and turn-frequency.

This is built entirely in Ocaml, with the intent being to use it for both the Front and Backend.

Will probably use HTMX for the reactivity.

Currently the libraries I'm intending to use are: 

- core
- tyxml
- dream
- sqlite3

However, this may grow as the project evolves.
